    "\n",
    "This page demonstrates the most basic sort of antenna optimization: adjusting an antenna's dimensions to produce the lowest peak VSWR within some band of frequencies. For the moment we won't be taking into account any matching schemes, just direct feedline connection to the antenna. Some examples using series section matching, for example, will be presented in subsequent files.\n",

    "\n",
    "This library contains a host of optimization algorithms, but at the moment we'll only be using a simple single-objective genetic algorithm. Elsewhere on this site we'll have examples of more advanced tasks, e.g. multi-objective optimization to explore trade-offs between forward gain, F/B, and bandwidth in Yagi design.\n",
