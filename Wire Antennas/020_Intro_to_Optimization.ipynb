    "This page demonstrates the most basic sort of antenna optimization: adjusting an antenna's dimensions to produce the lowest peak VSWR within some band of frequencies. For the moment we won't be taking into account any matching schemes, just direct feedline connection to the antenna. Some examples using series section matching, for example, will be presented in subsequent files.\n",
