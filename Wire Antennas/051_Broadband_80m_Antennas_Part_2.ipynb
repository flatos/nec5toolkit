    "\n",
    "Earlier notebooks provide examples of designing cage dipoles to increase bandwidth, and in particular using a 'cage' for only a portion of the antenna's length (the remainder being a single wire) to effect a tradeoff between bandwidth and the amount of wire used.\n",

    "Based on previous results I'm going to choose a 'cage' consisting of two wires (so really just a pair of parallel wires) as being the most wire-efficient design.\n",
