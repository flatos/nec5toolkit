    "\n",
    "It's well known that a standard dipole antenna can't provide a low VSWR over the entire frequency range of the 80 meter band. This notebook looks at some published designs that improve on the dipole's bandwidth. Some of the code presented in previous notebooks is used to optimize antenna geometries and feedline matching arrangements to extract maximum frequency coverage from the designs.\n",
